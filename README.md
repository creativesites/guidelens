# GuideLens

An AI-powered mobile application delivering real-time, context-aware advice through video analysis for diverse tasks such as cooking, DIY repairs, and mental health support.

## Overview

GuideLens is a cutting-edge mobile app that leverages periodic video screenshots and advanced AI models to provide personalized, actionable guidance. By integrating OpenAI’s real-time API for audio/text processing and xAI’s vision models for scene analysis, GuideLens enables users to receive context-specific advice for activities like preparing a meal, fixing a car, or engaging in wellness conversations. With support for English and localized languages like Nyanja and Shona, GuideLens targets a global audience while addressing underserved markets such as Zambia and Zimbabwe.

The minimum viable product (MVP) includes three specialized agents—Cooking Assistant, DIY Helper, and Crafting Guru—alongside a Zambia-specific mental health buddy, optimized for low-bandwidth environments through innovative algorithms and local caching.

## Features

- **Video Context Analysis**: Processes screenshots every 30 seconds to identify objects and actions, enabling tailored advice (e.g., “Add more water to the pot”).
- **Multilingual Support**: Delivers responses in English, Nyanja, and Shona via audio and text for inclusive user experiences.
- **Mental Health Buddy**: Provides Zambia-only, regulation-compliant wellness prompts based on mood analysis (e.g., “You seem stressed, try this breathing exercise”).
- **Low-Bandwidth Optimization**: Utilizes on-device processing and cached responses to ensure accessibility in low-connectivity regions.
- **Technical Innovation**: Employs novel algorithms, including Hybrid Vision Processing, Multi-Modal Context Fusion, and Emotion and Intent Recognition, to enhance efficiency and personalization.

## Installation

The project is under active development. Installation instructions for the MVP will be provided upon release. Stay tuned for updates on building and running GuideLens locally.

## Usage

GuideLens is designed for seamless interaction:
1. Open the app and select an agent (e.g., Cooking Assistant).
2. Point your phone’s camera at the task (e.g., a cooking setup).
3. Speak or type a query, and receive real-time, context-aware advice.
4. For mental health support, engage with the Zambia-specific buddy for empathetic prompts.

Detailed usage guides and demo videos will be available in future releases.
